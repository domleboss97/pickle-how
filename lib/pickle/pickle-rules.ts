export const rulesText = `# SIGNIFICANT RULE CHANGES FOR 2024

## Correcting Server, Receiver and Player Position Errors (4.B.9)

Faults for incorrect server, incorrect receiver and player position
errors are eliminated. The referee will now correct any such player
errors before calling the score. Rule 4.B.9 is the primary rule text.
Several other rules have been modified or deleted to correlate
with this change.

## Draping Net (2.C.6/11.L.5.b)

Rule 2.C.6 called for a replay when a ball goes over the net and
hits a net that is draped on the ground (except on a serve) but
only if the referee determined that the ball was affected by the
draped net. This rule, and Rule 11.L.5.b for temporary nets, now
call for a replay without qualification. A determination that the ball
was affected by the draped net is now not required in officiated or
non-officiated play.

## Catch or Carry Ball on the Paddle (7.L)

Rule 7.L now makes catching or carrying a ball on the paddle a
fault without having to determine that the catch or carry was
deliberately done.

## Conceding a Rally (13.E.4/13.E.5)

Rule 13.E.5 calls for a replay when a player overrules to their
detriment a line judge's 'out' call as 'in.' The player or team may
now choose to concede the rally to their opponent if they
determine they would have been unable to return the 'in' ball.
Similarly, Rule 13.E.4 calls for a replay when the referee overturns a
line judge's out call as in. The player or team who benefitted from
the referee's ruling may now choose to concede the rally to their
opponent if they determine they would have been unable to
return the 'in' ball.

## Medical Time-Outs (10.B.2.c)

A player is now allowed to use available standard time-outs after
the 15-minute medical time-out has expired to allow more time
before the player must retire from the match.

## NOTE related to medical time-outs: Case 5-23 in the USAP

Casebook establishes how and when a player can rescind a
requested medical time-out, and that the medical time-out would
not be charged to the player. The ruling has been revised to
require that the requested medical time-out be charged to the
player.

## Paddle Specifications (2.E.2/2.E.5.a/2.E.5.c)

Paddle specifications have been updated to address new and
emerging paddle technology and features and to clarify the
alterations that players are allowed to make to certified paddles.

## Mini-Singles (12.O)

Mini-singles is currently an approved format. The specific rules
governing mini-singles are now incorporated in the Rulebook.

# Section 1 - The Game

Pickleball is a paddle sport played using a special perforated ball
on a 20-foot-by-44-foot court with a tennis-type net. The court is
divided into right/even and left/odd service courts and non-volley
zones. (See Figure 2-1.)

The ball is served diagonally across the net to the opponent's
receiving court using an approved motion. The ball is struck back
and forth across the net until a player fails to return the ball in
accordance with the rules.

Points are scored only by the serving side when the server or the
server's team wins the rally, or the opposing side commits a fault.
The server continues to serve, alternating service courts, until the
serving side loses the rally or commits a fault.

Typically, the first side scoring 11 points and leading by at least a
2-point margin wins.

Pickleball can be played as singles or doubles.

## The Players

Pickleball is a game that requires cooperation and courtesy. A
sense of fair play from giving the opponent the benefit of any
doubt is essential in maintaining the game's underlying principles
of fun and competition. To that end:

- All points played are treated the same regardless of their
  importance; the first point of the match is as important as
  match point.
- Either partner in doubles can make calls, especially line
  calls; there is no place in the game for one partner telling
  another, “That was my call, not yours.”
- Prompt calls eliminate the 'two chance option.' For
  example, a player cannot claim a hinder from a ball rolling
  on the court after they hit a ball 'out'; they gave up their
  ability to call the hinder by choosing instead to hit the ball.
- Players strive to cooperate when confronted with a
  situation not covered by the Rulebook. Possible outcomes
  can be a replay, allowing the rally to stand, or in extreme
  cases, asking for a referee to resolve a dispute.
- Where possible, rules accommodate players with various
  adaptive needs
- Players avoid wearing clothing that closely matches the
  ball color.
- Players should not question or comment on an opponent's
  call, although any player may appeal a rally-ending line call
  to the referee before the next serve occurs.

## Unique Features

Two-Bounce Rule. After the ball is served, each side must make
one groundstroke prior to volleying the ball.

Non-Volley Zone (NVZ). An area that extends 7 feet from the net
on each side, within which a player is not allowed to strike the ball
without it first bouncing. More specifically, the whole court from
net to baseline is the same and can be freely used for all play with
one exception: volleying. The first seven feet, the non-volley zone,
cannot be used for volleying.

**(Wheelchair)** Players using wheelchairs may allow the ball to
bounce twice before returning the ball. The second bounce can
be anywhere on the playing surface, which includes the area
surrounding the court.

    hand, the server shall not impart manipulation or spin
    on the ball with any part of the body immediately
    prior to the serve. Exceptions: Any player may use
    their paddle to perform the drop serve (see Rule
    4.A.8.a). A player who has the use of only one hand
    may also use their paddle to release the ball to
    perform the volley serve.
  - 4.A.6. In officiated matches, the server's release of the ball
    must be visible to the referee and receiver. In
    matches without a referee, the server's release of the
    ball must be visible to the receiver. There is no fault if
    the release is not visible to the referee or receiver.
  - **4.A.7. The Volley Serve.** The volley serve is made by
    striking the ball without bouncing the ball off the
    playing surface and can be made with either a
    forehand or backhand motion. A proper volley serve
    includes the following elements:
    - 4.A.7.a. The server's arm must be moving in an
      upward arc at the time the ball is struck with
      the paddle. (See Figure 4-3.)
    - 4.A.7.b. The highest point of the paddle head must
      not be above the highest part of the wrist
      (where the wrist joint bends) when the
      paddle strikes the ball. (See Figures 4-1 and
      4-2)
    - 4.A.7.c. Contact with the ball must not be made
      above the waist. (See Figures 4-1 and 4-3
      above)
  - **4.A.8. The Drop Serve.** The drop serve is made by striking
    the ball after it bounces on the playing surface and
    can be made with either a forehand or backhand
    motion. There is no restriction how many times the
    ball can bounce nor where the ball can bounce on
    the playing surface. A proper drop serve includes the
    following elements:
    - 4.A.8.a. The server must release the ball from one
      hand only or drop it off the paddle face
      from any natural (un-aided) height.
    - 4.A.8.b. When releasing the ball, the ball shall not be
      propelled in any direction or in any manner
      prior to striking the ball to make the serve.
    - 4.A.8.c. The restrictions on the Volley Serve in Rule
      4.A.7 do not apply to the drop serve.
  - **4.A.9. Replay or Fault.** In officiated matches, the referee
    may call for a replay if they are not certain that one
    or more of the requirements of the serve has been
    met. The replay must be called before the return of
    serve. The referee shall call a fault if they are certain
    that one or more of the requirements of the serve,
    other than Rule 4.A.6, has not been met. In non-
    officiated matches, if the receiver determines that
    manipulation of spin has been imparted prior to the
    serve, or the release of the ball is not visible, the
    receiver may call for a replay before the return of
    serve. In non-officiated matches, the receiver has no
    authority to call for replays or faults for service
    motion violations.

- **4.B. Player Positions.**

  - 4.B.1. Server and Receiver. The correct server and receiver
    and their positions are determined by the score and
    the players' starting positions in the game.
  - 4.B.2. At the start of each game, the starting server begins
    the serve from the side of the court dictated by the
    score.
  - 4.B.3. Each player will serve until a rally is lost or a fault is
    declared against the player or team.
  - 4.B.4. As long as the server holds serve, after each point the
    server will alternate serving from the right/even and
    left/odd sides of the court.
  - 4.B.5. Singles.
    - 4.B.5.a. If the server's score is even (0, 2, 4 ...), the
      serve must be made from the right/even
      serving area and be received in the
      right/even service court by the opponent.
    - 4.B.5.b. If the server's score is odd (1, 3, 5 ...), the
      serve must be made from the left/odd
      serving area and be received in the left/odd
      service court by the opponent.
    - 4.B.5.c. After the server loses the rally or faults, a
      side out will occur and service is awarded to
      the opponent.
  - 4.B.6. Doubles. Both players on a team will serve before a
    side out is declared, except at the start of each game,
    when only the starting server will serve. The starting
    server of each game is therefore designated as
    “Second Server” for scoring purposes, since a side out
    will occur once a rally is lost or a fault is committed
    by the serving team and service is awarded to the
    opposing team.
    - 4.B.6.a. At the start of each side out, service begins
      in the right/even serving area.
    - 4.B.6.b. When the team's score is even (0, 2, 4 ...),
      the team's starting server's correct position
      is at the right/even serving area. When the
      team's score is odd (1, 3, 5...), the starting
      server's correct position is at the left/odd
      court.
    - 4.B.6.c. After each side out, service begins with the
      player correctly positioned on the
      right/even side of the court according to the
      team's score. This player is referred to as
      “First Server” and the partner is “Second
      Server.”
    - 4.B.6.d. The First Server will serve, alternating service
      sides after each point is won, until a rally is
      lost or the server's team commits a fault.
    - 4.B.6.e. After the First Server's team loses a rally or
      faults, the Second Server will serve from the
      correct position and will alternate serving
      positions as long as the serving team
      continues to win points.
  - 4.B.7. Partner Positions. In doubles, with the exception of
    the server (see 4.A.4), there is no restriction on the
    position of any player, as long as all players are on
    their respective team's side of the net. They can be
    positioned on or off the court. The correct server
    must serve from the correct service court, and the
    correct receiver must receive the serve.
  - 4.B.8. Before the serve occurs, any player may ask the
    referee for the score, who is the correct server or
    receiver or whether any player is in an incorrect
    position. A generic question such as “Am I good?”
    may be asked and shall be considered to encapsulate
    both the correct server question and the correct
    position question if asked by the serving team. For
    non-officiated play, a player may ask the opponent
    the same questions and the opponent shall respond
    with the appropriate information.
  - 4.B.9. The referee will confirm and correct, if necessary, that
    all players are in the correct position and the correct
    server has the ball before calling the score.
    - 4.B.9.a. If the referee or a player stops a rally in
      progress to correctly identify a
      player/position error, the rally shall be
      replayed. If a player stops a rally and
      incorrectly identifies a player/position error,
      it is a fault on the player who stopped the
      rally. If the referee stops a rally in progress
      and incorrectly identifies a player/position
      error, the rally shall be replayed.
    - 4.B.9.b. If a player/position error is identified after
      the rally has played out, the rally shall stand.

- **4.C. Readiness.** Any player may indicate “not ready” prior to the
  start of the score being called.
  - 4.C.1. One of the following signals must be used to indicate
    “not ready”: 1) raising the paddle above the head, 2)
    raising the non-paddle hand above the head, 3)
    completely turning their back to the net.
  - 4.C.2. After the start of the score being called, “not ready”
    signals will be ignored, unless there is a hinder. A
    player or team out of position is not considered a
    hinder.
- **4.D. Calling the Score.** The score shall be called after the server
  and receiver are (or should be) in position and all players are
  (or should be) ready to play.
  - 4.D.1. In non-officiated play, the server normally calls the
    score, but the server's partner may call the score if
    the server is unable to call the score. The person
    calling the score shall not change during the game
    unless there is a voice impairment.
- **4.E. 10-Second Rule.** Once the score has been called, the server
  is allowed 10 seconds to serve the ball.
  - 4.E.1. If the server exceeds 10 seconds to serve, a fault will
    be declared.
  - 4.E.2. After the score has been called, if the serving team
    changes serving courts, the referee shall stop play,
    allow all players to reposition, and then recall the
    score to re-start the 10-second count. In a non-
    officiated match, the server will allow for the same
    repositioning and will recall the score to re-start the
    10 second count.
- **4.F. Scoring.** A singles player or doubles team scores points only
  when serving. Points may also be awarded when technical
  fouls are called against the opposing side and their score is 0.
- **4.G. Points.** A point is scored by serving the ball and winning the
  rally.
- **4.H. Winning the Game.** The first side scoring the winning point
  wins.
- **4.I. Calling the Score in Singles Matches.** The proper sequence
  for calling the score is server score then receiver score as two
  numbers. (e.g., “one - zero.”)
- **4.J. Calling the Score in Doubles Matches.** The score is called
  as three numbers in doubles matches. The proper sequence
  for calling the score is: serving team's score - receiving
  team's score - the server number (one or two), (e.g., “zero -
  one - one”). To start each game, the score will be called as
  “zero - zero - two.”
- **4.K. Wrong Score Called.** If the wrong score is called, the referee
  or any player may stop play before the return of serve to
  correct the score. The rally shall be replayed with the correct
  score called. After the return of serve, play shall continue to
  the end of the rally and the score correction made before the
  next serve. After the return of serve, a player who stops play
  to identify or ask for a score correction will have committed a
  fault and shall lose the rally. A player who stops play after
  the serve to identify or ask for a score correction when the
  score was correctly called will have committed a fault and
  shall lose the rally.
- **4.L. Service Foot Faults.** During the serve, when the ball is
  struck, the server's feet shall:
  - 4.L.1. Not touch the area outside the imaginary extension
    of the sideline.
  - 4.L.2. Not touch the area on the wrong side of the
    imaginary extension of the centerline.
  - 4.L.3. Not touch the court, including the baseline.
- **4.M. Service Faults.** During the service, it is a fault against the
  server resulting in loss of serve if:
  - 4.M.1. The served ball touches any permanent object before
    it hits the ground.
  - 4.M.2. The served ball touches the server or their partner, or
    anything the server or their partner is wearing or
    holding.
  - 4.M.3. The served ball lands in the non-volley zone which
    includes the NVZ lines.
  - 4.M.4. The served ball lands outside the service court.
  - 4.M.5. The served ball hits the net and lands inside the non-
    volley zone.
  - 4.M.6. The served ball hits the net and lands outside the
    service court.
  - 4.M.7. The server uses an illegal serve when performing the
    Volley Serve (as explained in Rule 4.A.7) or the Drop
    Serve (as explained in Rule 4.A.8).
  - 4.M.8. The server or their partner calls a time-out after the
    serve has occurred.
  - 4.M.9. The server hits the ball to make the serve while the
    score is being called.
  - 4.M.10. The server violates any of the rules listed in Rule
    4.A.4.
- **4.N. Receiver Faults.** It is a fault against the receiving team
  resulting in a point for the server if:
  - 4.N.1. The receiver or their partner is touched by or
    interferes with the flight of the ball before it bounces.
  - 4.N.2. The receiver or their partner calls a time-out after the
    serve has occurred.

# SECTION 5 - SERVICE AND END SELECTION RULES

- **5.A. Selection of End, Serve, Receive, or Defer.**
  - 5.A.1. Any fair method shall be used to determine which
    player or team has first choice of end, serve, receive,
    or defer (e.g., a 1 or 2 written on the back of the
    score sheet, flipping a coin). If the winner chooses to
    serve or receive first, the loser chooses the starting
    end. If the winner chooses the starting end, the loser
    chooses to serve or receive. Once a selection has
    been made, it cannot be changed.
  - 5.A.2. In doubles, teams may change the starting server
    between games and should notify the referee. In
    non-officiated matches, the team should notify the
    opponents if there was a starting server change. The
    starting server for the game is the player wearing the
    starting server form of identification. There is no fault
    or penalty for failure to make the notifications. Once
    a game has started, if the referee notices a starting
    server has changed, the referee will annotate the
    scoresheet accordingly, after the rally has completed.
  - 5.A.3. In doubles, the starting servers must visibly wear the
    form of identification determined by the Tournament
    Director.
- **5.B. Change of Ends.**
  - 5.B.1. Teams switch ends and initial service upon the
    completion of each game.
  - 5.B.2. Two minutes is allowed between games. If both
    teams agree, play may resume early. Rule 10.A.5 shall
    be used to continue play.
  - 5.B.3. In a match with two out of three games to 11 points,
    in game three, the teams will switch ends when the
    first team reaches a score of 6. Serve remains with the
    player holding serve. Exception: If the first game of
    such match was forfeited due to late arrival, the
    teams will not switch ends during game three.
  - 5.B.4. In a game to 15 points, the teams will switch end
    when the first team reaches a score of 8. Serve
    remains with the player holding serve.
    5.B.5. In a game to 21 points, the teams will switch ends
    when the first team reaches a score of 11. Serve
    remains with the player holding serve.
  - 5.B.6. End Change Time-Out. One minute is allowed to
    switch ends during a game. Rule 10.A.5 shall be used
    to continue play.
  - 5.B.7. Once the end change point has been scored, a
    technical foul resulting in the loss of a point for the
    serving team shall have no impact on the completion
    of the end change.
  - 5.B.8. In a match with three out of five games to 11 points,
    in game five, the teams will switch ends when the first
    team reaches a score of 6. Serve remains with the
    player holding serve.
  - 5.B.9. If the end change fails to be executed per Rules 5.B.3,
    5.B.4, 5.B.5 or 5.B.8, the end change will be executed
    when realized. It is not a fault on either team, score is
    not impacted and serve remains with the player
    holding the serve.

# SECTION 6 - LINE CALL RULES

- **6.A** A served ball that clears the non-volley zone and its lines and
  lands in the correct service court or on any correct service
  court line is in. Any other ball in play that lands in the court
  or touches any court line is in.
- **6.B** A ball contacting the playing surface completely outside of
  the court is “out.” A served ball that lands in the opponent's
  non-volley zone, including on the non-volley zone lines, is
  "out".
- **6.C. Code of Ethics for Line Calling.** Pickleball is played
  according to specific rules. It also requires a code of ethics
  for line-calling responsibilities when performed by players.
  The line-calling responsibilities of players are different from
  those assigned to referees or line judges. The officials make
  impartial judgment calls with all players' interests in mind.
  The player, when assigned line-calling duties, must strive for
  accuracy and operate under the principle that all
  questionable calls must be resolved in favor of the opponent.
  The basic elements are:
  - 6.C.1 Players are responsible for calling the lines on their
    end of the court (excluding short serves, service foot
    faults and all non-volley-zone faults, if being called
    by a referee). If a player makes an initial line call, and
    then asks for either the opponent(s) or the referee's
    opinion, if the opponent or referee can make a clear
    “in” or “out” call, the clear call will stand. If no clear
    call can be made, the initial line call by the player will
    stand. A call made by the opponent can be appealed
    to the referee for a final “in” or “out” decision.
  - 6.C.2. Players' only line call is the centerline on the serve in
    matches that have line judges.
  - 6.C.3. The opponent gets the benefit of the doubt on line
    calls made. Any ball that cannot be called “out” will
    be considered “in.” A player cannot claim a replay
    because the ball was not seen or there is uncertainty.
    A player who does not make a call may appeal to the
    referee to make the call if they did not clearly see the
    ball land. If the referee is unable to make the call, the
    ball is “in.” The moment the receiving player/team
    appeals to the referee, they lose their right to make
    any subsequent "in" or "out" call for that rally.
  - 6.C.4. Spectators should not be consulted on any line call.
  - 6.C.5. A player/team may ask the opponent's opinion to
    make the line call on the player's end of the court. If
    requested and the opponent makes a clear “in” or
    “out” call, it must be accepted. If the opponents
    cannot make a clear “in” or “out” call, then the ball is
    ruled as being “in” on the receiving team. The
    moment the receiving player/team asks for the
    opponent's opinion, they lose their right to make any
    subsequent "in" or "out" call for that rally. The
    receiving team/player may also appeal to the referee
    to make a clear call. If the referee cannot make a clear
    call, the outcome of the opponent's ruling will stand.
  - 6.C.6. Players shall not call a ball “out” unless they can
    clearly see a space between the line and the ball as it
    hits the ground.
  - 6.C.7. All “out” calls must be made prior to the ball being
    hit by the opponent or before the ball becomes dead.
  - 6.C.8. In doubles play, if one player calls the ball “out” and
    the partner calls it “in,” then doubt exists and the
    team's call will be “in.” Any player may appeal a call
    to the referee. If the referee did not see the ball, the
    ball is considered in.
  - 6.C.9. “Out” line calls must be promptly signaled by voice
    and/or hand signal (as described in Rule 13.E.2).
  - 6.C.10. While the ball is in the air, if a player yells “out,” “no,”
    “bounce it,” or any other words to communicate to
    their partner that the ball may be out, it shall be
    considered player communication only and not
    considered a line call.
  - 6.C.11. An “out” call made after the ball bounces is a line call.
    The ball is dead and play shall stop. If, upon appeal,
    the referee overrules any type of “out” call, it is a fault
    against the player or team that made the “out” call.
    Exception: If the match has line judges, the baseline
    and sideline judges are responsible for the call. (See
    Rule 13.E.2)
  - 6.C.12. After the completion of a rally, players may overrule a
    partner's line call, their own line call, an officiating
    team's line call, or an opponent's “in” call to their own
    disadvantage.

# SECTION 7 - FAULT RULES

A fault (and resulting dead ball) will be declared for the following:

- 7.A. If the serve or service return does not bounce before the ball
  is struck.
- 7.B. Hitting the ball into the player's side of the net without the
  ball crossing over to the opponent's side. Note: The ball is
  dead and the fault occurs the moment the ball hits the
  ground.
- 7.C. Hitting the ball under the net or between the net and the net
  post.
- 7.D. A ball hit by a player that first lands out of bounds or onto
  their own side of the court.
- 7.E. Failure of a standing player to return the ball before it
  bounces twice on the receiving player's side of the net and
  failure of a player using a wheelchair to return a ball before it
  bounces three times.
- 7.F. Violation of Section 4, Section 9, and Section 11 rules.
- 7.G. A player, a player's apparel, or a player's paddle contacting
  the net system, the net posts, or the opponent's court, when
  the ball is live.
- 7.H. After the serve, the ball contacts a player or anything the
  player is wearing or carrying, except the paddle or the
  player's hand(s) in contact with the paddle and below the
  wrist. If the player is in the process of changing hands with
  both hands on the paddle or is attempting a two-handed
  stroke and either hand is hit below the wrist, as long as a
  player's hand is in contact with the paddle, the ball is still in
  play. The fault is on the player who was hit by the ball.
- 7.I. A ball in play that is stopped by a player before it becomes
  dead (e.g., catching or stopping a ball in flight before it
  makes contact with the playing surface). The fault is on the
  player who stopped the ball. Exception: See Rule 4.B.9.a.
- 7.J. After the serve, a ball contacting any permanent object
  before bouncing on the court.
- 7.K. Once the ball is in play, a player hitting the ball before the
  ball entirely crosses the plane of the net.
- 7.L. A player carrying or catching the ball on the paddle while
  performing the serve or during a rally.
- 7.M. A hinder called by a player that is determined by the referee
  to be invalid.
- 7.N. In non-officiated matches, players may carry an additional
  pickleball(s) as long as the ball(s) is carried in a way that the
  ball(s) is not visible to their opponent(s) during play. If an
  additional ball that a player was carrying falls on the playing
  surface during play, a fault shall be declared.

# SECTION 8 - DEAD BALL RULES

- 8.A. Any action that stops play will result in a dead ball.
- 8.B. A fault called by a referee or player, or a fault committed by
  a player, will result in a dead ball.
- 8.C. A hinder called by the referee or player will result in a dead
  ball. The referee will determine if the hinder called by the
  player was valid. A valid hinder per the Referee or a hinder
  called in non-officiated play will result in a replay.
- 8.D. A ball in play that contacts a permanent object after it has
  bounced on the opponent's court will result in a dead ball.
  The player who hit the ball shall win the rally.
- 8.E. Other than non-volley zone violations, a fault may only be
  committed when the ball is live. The penalty for a fault (other
  than non-volley zone faults) is normally enforced the
  moment it is identified (e.g., distractions, double bounces,
  etc.) but may also be enforced any time before the next
  serve occurs.

# SECTION 9 - NON-VOLLEY-ZONE RULES

- 9.A. All volleys must be initiated outside of the non-volley zone.
  For players using wheelchairs, the front (smaller) wheels may
  touch the non-volley zone during a volley.
- 9.B. It is a fault if the volleying player or anything that has
  contact with the volleying player while in the act of volleying
  touches the non-volley zone. For players using wheelchairs,
  the front (smaller) wheels may touch the non-volley zone.
  - 9.B.1. The act of volleying the ball includes the swing, the
    follow-through, and the momentum from the action.
  - 9.B.2. If the paddle touches the non-volley zone during the
    volley motion, before or after contacting the ball, it is
    a fault.
- 9.C. During the act of volleying, it is a fault if the volleying
  player's momentum causes the player to contact anything
  that is touching the non-volley zone, including the player's
  partner. For players using wheelchairs, the front (smaller)
  wheels may touch the non-volley zone.
  - 9.C.1. It is a fault even if the ball becomes dead before the
    player contacts the non-volley zone.
- 9.D. If a player has touched the non-volley zone for any reason,
  that player cannot volley a return until both feet have made
  contact with the playing surface completely outside the non-
  volley zone. A maneuver such as standing within the non-
  volley zone, jumping up to hit a volley, and then landing
  outside the non-volley zone is a fault. If the rear wheels of a
  wheelchair have touched the non-volley zone for any reason,
  the player using a wheelchair cannot volley a return until
  both rear wheels have made contact with the playing surface
  outside the non-volley zone.
- 9.E. A player may enter the non-volley zone at any time except
  when that player is volleying the ball.
- 9.F. A player may enter the non-volley zone before or after
  returning any ball that bounces.
- 9.G. A player may stay inside the non-volley zone to return a ball
  that has bounced. There is no violation if a player does not
  exit the non-volley zone after hitting a ball that bounces.
- 9.H. There is no violation if a player returns the ball while their
  partner is standing in the non-volley zone.
